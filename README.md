This repository contains a collection of **Python practice projects** developed during my training at **Maktab Sharif Educational Institute**.

The projects focus on applying core Python concepts such as data structures, built-in modules, and basic problem-solving techniques.  
While educational in nature, they go beyond trivial examples and include practical explorations of Python behavior.

**Thank you for your attention and for taking the time to review this repository!**
